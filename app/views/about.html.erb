      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Tasker is an application made for not only keeping track of your tasks
      and assignments, but also being able to share those tasks within a group.
      The app was originally created for a coding class project with the intention
      of dividing up assignments for group projects or a way to store chores in a
      household/roommate group.</p><br>

      <h2>Guide</h2>

      <h4>Getting Started</h4>
      <p>When you create a profile with Tasker, you automatically get a group called
      "My Tasks" that is meant to contain any personal tasks you may have. You can
      change the name of this group to anything you wish, add members if you choose,
      or even delete it. You can create new groups and title them as you wish. Within
      any of your groups, you can create tasks.</p><br>

      <h4>Creating Tasks</h4>
      <p>On Tasker, tasks are formatted such that they have a title and "todos".
      Todos are especially meant for large tasks, such as a project where you may need
      to (for example) 1. do research, 2. conduct interviews, 3. write a paper, 4. edit
      said paper, and finally, 5. turn that paper in. Todos can also be as simple as
      items on a shopping list. Really, it's up to you how to format your tasks within
      groups.</p><br>

      <h4>Owners vs. Members</h4>
      <p>Every group you create, you are the owner of. However, you can also be a member
      of a group. Owners can add members, edit a group title/description, delete tasks,
      and can delete the group. Owners and members can create and edit tasks within a group.
      Therefore, you will want to be careful with who you add to your groups.</p><br>
