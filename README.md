# Tasker

Created by Laura Berge as part of the Flatiron School Curriculum.
The project required an MVC CRUD Sinatra web application.


## About Tasker (more can be found in the about page of the application):

Tasker is an application made for not only keeping track of your tasks
and assignments, but also being able to share those tasks within a group. When you
create a profile with Tasker, you automatically get a group called "My Tasks"
that is meant to contain any personal tasks you may have.
You can change the name of this group to anything you wish, add members if you choose,
or even delete it. You can create new groups and title them as you wish. Within
any of your groups, you can create tasks. See the about page of the app or the about file
(app/views/about.html.erb) for more information.


## Install Instructions

If you want to run Tasker, feel free to fork and clone this repo. Make sure to
run both:

bundle install

rake db:migrate

before starting. Then feel free to run shotgun to play around with the application
and create profiles locally.
